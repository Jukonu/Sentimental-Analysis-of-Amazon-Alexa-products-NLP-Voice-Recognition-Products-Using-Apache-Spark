# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Amazon-Alexa-products-NLP-Voice-Recognition-Products-Using-Apache-Spark
This study tends to analyze Amazonâ€™s Alexa products; to predict feedback views on the Amazon Alexa products using text, variation, and feedbacks. Train machine learning models for sentiment analysis and analyze customer reviews by showing distributions of positive reviews as well as negative reviews. Also, it will display some exploratory data analysis that will reveal distributions of unique variations contained in the dataset. Models to be used will be Text classification, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting  Train a number of different models on the training set and evaluate each one on the validation set to see which model generalizes best to the unseen data. The test set will be used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the tuned model. The test set is used only once to evaluate the final model. Upon which decision can be made to choose which model provides optimal feedbacks. Models employed were weighted Loss Logistic Regression upon up-sampling the imbalanced dataset.   Second and third models employed are random forest and GBT upon splitting the DataFrame into testing and training data set and up-sampling the training the data set and fitting the pipeline on the up-sampled data set.
